	if installed in a mission file, any player joining the mission
	will see credits on their screen as configured below. Players have the ability to skip credits by using the scroll menu action which is available until the credits are done showing.

	PARAMS: None.

	NOTES:
	this script concept was 1st released by IT07 for ArmA 2, then a guy called "Gr8" copy-pasted the concept and published it for ArmA 3 without permission.
