# ArmA 3 ScarCode Scripts Bundle by IT07
Hi and thanks for checking out this repository.<br />
It is important to note that all of the script below are designed for ArmA 3 Epoch mod.<br />
Small structural changes need to be applied to get them working for a different mod however that is not the purpose of these scripts.<br />
*NOTE: These scripts are all designed and written by IT07. Publishing permissions apply.*

#### Installation summary
1) Pick a or multiple script(s) that you want to have and copy the ScarCode folder that is in it to the root of your mission file. <br />
2) If there is also a folder in there called a3_scarcode_server, merge them with the already existing one. Do not merge the init.sqf though. Just combine contents of both into one. <br />
3) Global configs for enabling/disabling script is located inside ScarCode\SC_init.sqf. Any other configs for the menus can be found in ScarCode\GUI\Configs.<br />
4) Check the description.ext example included with this repository and add the required lines for each script that you want to have.<br />
5) For PSR there is also a config file in a3_scarode_server\PSR called initServer_PSR.sqf. You will need to add the UIDs of your support units in there.<br />
6) Sorry for this very brief installation guide it is very demanding to make scripts let alone explaining to beginners by text on how to install it.<br />
